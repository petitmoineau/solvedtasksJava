Generation gap. Your own experience 
I`ve never faced with a generation gap. And this is another reason I`m fond of my nuclear and extended family. 
I`m sure that generation gap literally has its place in each and every family but cope or not to cope
with it - the choice that is made by everybody. I have tried a lot being a teenager: I used to listen 
to gifferent kinds of music such as rock, metal, 
national pop singers like Vitalii Kozlovskyi and so one, I was a goth(its a subculture that is 
characterized by people who listen to death rock, post-punk music, the style includes dark attire, 
dark hair and dark makeup), an emo girl(black and pink appearance, emotional rock music and so one)
I`ve always been a study-girl, but in age of 15 I started to go out with friends, 
tried some bad things, different companies, I also was acting in videos, short movies, I participated in 
theatre. And I`ve never heard from my family anything like "In our times we were more responsible and 
hard-working". I`ve never felt any infringement upon my interests, hobbies, acquaintances etc. Even my 
grandparents have always tried to understand me and get to know me better. Accordingly to the fact that 
some of my family members are into arts, music and poetry, I was growing on classical music, museums of 
contemporary art, filarmonies, books and cinematography. Consequently, I`ve got a great intellectual base. 
Maybe that`s the reason why my parents and grandparents wasn`t afraid of my new musical preferences, new interests, 
hobbies and friends - because now I know what is good for me, what harms me and what I`d like to surround myself 
with. My family is loving and understanding, we try to keep being all together and all of these are 
the reasons we put a lot of effort to understand each other and even try as much as we can. That`s why I think
in my family there is no place for judgement and rows, provoked by the generation gap.
